Fork xxmi-gimi for build dll.
========

**XXMI DLL** is a fork of [3dmigoto](https://github.com/bo3b/3Dmigoto/), a Direct3D modding tool. Developed as part of the **XXMI Project** by the [AGMG Community](https://discord.gg/agmg), it serves as a core component of the xxmi-gimi mods. This fork focuses on streamlining the original, enhances compatibility and introduces performance and usability improvements.

## Key differences

* Legacy projects have been removed from the solution.
* All stereoscopic (3D) features have been stripped, making this fork effectively a "2Dmigoto".
* Codebase has been updated for compatibility with **Visual Studio 2022**.

## New features

* Micro-optimizations to reduce config reload times and main loop FPS impact.
* UTF-8 support for file paths and namespaces.
* Configurable buffers resizing support, also known as "vertex limit raise" (backward-compatible with GIMI `.dll` implementation).
* GPU-to-INI scope data transfer support via `store` command (backward-compatible with GIMI `.dll` implementation).
* Periodic auto-saving of mod settings (persistent vars are saved to `d3dx_user.ini` every 1 minute by default).
* Support for remote DLL loading (allows the loader `.exe` to reside in a separate directory).
